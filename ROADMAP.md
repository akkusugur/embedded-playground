# Embedded Software Learning Roadmap

This roadmap outlines my structured approach to learning
embedded software development, inspired by industry practices.

## Phase 1: Foundations
- Git & GitHub workflow
- C language fundamentals
- Memory model, pointers, and data types
- Basic build concepts

## Phase 2: Microcontrollers
- MCU architecture basics
- Registers and peripherals
- GPIO, timers, and interrupts
- STM32 introduction

## Phase 3: RTOS
- Task scheduling concepts
- FreeRTOS fundamentals
- Synchronization mechanisms
- Timing and real-time constraints

## Phase 4: Applied Projects
- Small embedded demos
- Peripheral driver development
- RTOS-based applications
